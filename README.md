# Simple Web App

In this project, I am creating a few  a simple apps to learn about python development.
This repo includes examples that uses following components/practices:

* git/github
* poetry package manager
* debian linux distribution (manage and run code)
* makefile
* docker
* kubernetes (minikube/cubectl/cubectx)
* ci/cd (testing and deployment)

## Notes about Poetry
The project is using poetry as a dependency- and package manager.
To run the project you need to have Python and Poetry installed.

## Notes about Linux/Debian

When running poetry on debian, it is important that pip is installed and updated for python2 and python3.
The following guide is great: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-debian-9/#install-pip-for-python-2

# Simple Web App

In this project, I am creating a few a simple apps to learn about python and devops.
The different apps touch basic concepts of working with:
* git/github
* poetry package manager
* debian linux distribution (manage and run code)
* makefile
* docker
* kubernetes (minikube/cubectl/cubectx)
* ci/cd (testing and deployment)

## app1
The first app accomplishes:
* manage python virtualenvironment and dependencies with Poetry
* setting up a basic flask app that prints hello world
* setting up makefile to document different ways of running the ap

## app2
The second app accomplishes:
* extending flask app with a simple page to (1) read inputs (2) calculate a result based on some logic (3) return result to user
* adding a few test cases to run against the logic

## app3
The third app accomplishes:
* restructuring the code into packages under src folder (requires pythonpath reference, but updating pyproject.toml)
* running the flask app from a package, instead of file (ie. "flaskapp" -- required main file)
* setting up Dockerfile to create image and run the app in a container

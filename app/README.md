# Building a small app for docker

This folder includes two small apps to be used in my docker examples.

## app1
This app accomplishes:
* manage python virtualenvironment and dependencies with Poetry
* setting up a basic flask app that prints hello world
* setting up makefile to document different ways of running the ap

## app2
This app accomplishes:
* extending flask app with a simple page to (1) read inputs (2) calculate a result based on some logic (3) return result to user
* adding a few test cases to run against the logic
